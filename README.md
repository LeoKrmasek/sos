Code for my operating system development (restarted since I forgot too much :)

## Requirements
You need to install bochs into your home directory under `~/opt/bochs`,
so that its binary is accessible under `~/opt/bochs/bin/bochs`.

For compiling the ASM files, you'll need `nasm`.

## Compiling
To compile, call `make`.
